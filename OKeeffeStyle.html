            <p>The aesthetic style of my map is inspired by Georgia O‚ÄôKeeffe‚Äôs vibrant landscape painting, <i>Black Mesa Landscape, New Mexico / Out Back of Marie‚Äôs II</i>, 1930. For the land, I use the colors of the mountains, hills, and forest in her landscape. The deep blues and purples, peaches and greens became the colors of the land cover and elevation layers. For the colors of the ocean and fresh water, I used shades of blue from the stream in O‚ÄôKeeffe‚Äôs <i>Chama River, Ghost Ranch</i>, 1937, because Black Mesa Landscape didn‚Äôt include the necessary shades of light blue. Instead of labeling the cities, I found a flower icon (made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com) that draws to mind O‚ÄôKeeffe‚Äôs well-known flower paintings. The greens of the flower icons were selected from Black Mesa Landscape. I included country and state/region labels at the mid-zoom levels to help with orientation, but they disappear at the highest and lowest zoom levels encouraging the map user to simply focus on the flowing patterns of land and water or use natural feature labels, city flowers, and the shapes of mountains and lakes to find a specific place.

Bassau, the capital city of Guinea-Bissau, is visualized as a point feature with a larger rose, while the province and regional capitals are as smaller roses.

For the other land cover category, which encompasses desert and hard-to-reach places, I chose the light peach color, which evokes sandy, dry places.</p>

The dramatic elevation changes here offer a gorgeous gradient from white to navy to purple to peach, showing how well the colors O‚ÄôKeeffe used in <i>Black Mesa Landscape</i> work together. The topography data enables gradual transitions, which are difficult to replicate in coarse data divided up into few categories, like the land cover data, and also accentuates natural features like river valleys, which are prominent in O‚ÄôKeeffe‚Äôs work.</p>

The blues were chosen from <i>Chama River, Ghost Ranch</i>, 1937.</p>

The landcover colors also follow the order of the colors in Black Mesa at a higher zoom level.
