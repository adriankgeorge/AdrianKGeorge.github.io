            <h4 id="spruce-story"> Spruce </h4>
                <p class="paragraph">Spruce trees are found today in northern temperate and boreal North America and are well-adapted to cold temperatures. A key spruce feature is their cones that hang down from their branches. Due to their cold tolerance, they could survive near the edge of the ice sheet 20,000 years ago. As the ice sheet retreated and temperatures warmed, spruce moved into the empty landscapes left behind by glaciers in southern Canada earlier than many other trees. Today, spruce trees are found in Canada, the Pacific Northwest, and the eastern slopes of the Rock Mountains.</p>

        <div class="row taxon">
            <h4 id="oak-story"> Oak </h4>
                <p class="paragraph">Oaks are temperate trees that dominate 68 percent of hardwood forest across North America. At 20,000 years ago, they lived primarily in the southeast United States though some smaller populations survived closer to the ice sheet. By about 13,000 years ago, oaks were migrating northward both east and west of the Appalachians. Oaks are more fire-resistant than other trees, so they became a dominant species in the savannahs, which were part of a patchwork of prairie and oak savannahs across the Midwest and central Canada. Fire frequency and topography may have determined the patterns of savannah and prairie. There is some debate about whether indigenous people caused some fires or if warming temperatures and dry conditions were the primary cause.</p>

        <div class="row taxon">
            <h4 id="hemlock-story"> Hemlock </h4>
                <p class="paragraph">Hemlock trees are found on the west coast and in the eastern United States. They are large trees that create a shady forest environment. At about 14,000 years before present in the animation, you can see their populations in the Pacific Northwest, while the same happens in the east around 12,000 years ago. Hemlock populations continue to grow on both sides of the country as the ice retreats and temperatures warm. In the east, the hemlock trees also spread northwards. However, at about 5,500 years ago, something different happens with the eastern hemlocks. Their population collapses while the western hemlock populations stay large. Some possible reasons for the hemlock collapse are disease or climate. The eastern hemlock populations recovered, but today they face another threat from two invasive insect species.</p>

        <div class="row taxon">
            <h4 id="grasses-story"> Grasses </h4>
                <p class="paragraph">North American grasses include a large group of species. We group them together in paleoecology, because it is difficult to tell their pollen grains apart. In general, grasses are ‚Äúweedy‚Äù plants that are good at quickly reproducing and expanding to new areas. Scientists think that grasses could survive the cold temperatures near the ice sheet better than trees, because they die back and spend the winter underground ‚Äì where it is warmer - as roots. So, grasses, like spruce, moved into the empty land left behind by glaciers. You can see their particularly high numbers in the Great Plains, where fire keeps trees from taking over open spaces and grasses can continue to be the dominant species. Before mammoths and mastodons went extinct (about 4,000 years ago), they may have helped maintain a savannah-like ecosystem, where grasses could thrive, by eating and trampling small trees.</p>
